# Coffee Rub

*Coffee is used in a lot of Texas-style barbecue. My next-door neighbor and good friend, Sean, uses Garam Masala in his rubs and it inspired me to give it a try. It lends an interesting south-asian twist to the flavor of the meat, and it's proven amazing on pork, beef and chicken.*

* 1/2 cup coffee grounds
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 1/2 cup turbinado sugar
* 1/2 cup kosher salt
* 2 TB cinnamon
* 2 TB masala
